            <h1> Maddie Waldie </h1>
            <p> 
                I'm a senior Computer Science & Engineering student at Santa Clara University. 
                
                I'm a member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the Association for Computing Machinery - Women's Chapter (ACM-W). Additionally, during my last three summers, I worked as a software engineering intern at Apple.

                Advocacy for women in STEM is one of my passions, and over the years I have encouraged other girls to pursue STEM by participating in outreach events, creating workshops, and serving as a role model for younger girls. I was recently chosen as a National Center for Women and Information Technology Aspirations in Computing (NCWIT) national and affiliate awardee for my strong leadership, advocacy, and computing-related achievements.

                In my free time, I love baking, crocheting, reading, and taking care of my two kittens!
